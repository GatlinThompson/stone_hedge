<h2>Idea Conception</h2>
<p>This project was start as a way to help improve the accessibility for the user within my workplace. 
From combining two programs, a basic structure for easy logging and database coverage. As well as a simple user creation.
This was a very infomative final. Through the concepts given in the class, I was able to know what I was looking for and delve deeper into the mechanics of it all.
Overall, a very good class that you can explore and be creative with your work and a very good professor that provides very good feedback and help infomation to improve yourself in coding.
